Getting MEAN application code
=============================

This is the code for the sample 'Loc8r' application that is built through the course of my book Getting MEAN.

Getting MEAN is being published by Manning, and will be in early access soon.

There are named branches for the various states of the code throughout the book, starting with Chapter 3.
