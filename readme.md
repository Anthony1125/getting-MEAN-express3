Getting MEAN application code
=============================

This is the code for the sample 'Loc8r' application that is built through the course of my book [Getting MEAN](http://www.manning.com/sholmes/).

Getting MEAN is published by Manning, and is currently available through their early access program: [www.manning.com/sholmes/](http://www.manning.com/sholmes/)

There are named branches for the various states of the code throughout the book, so far:
* `chapter-03` **Chapter 3**: Creating and setting up a MEAN project
* `chapter-04` **Chapter 4**: Building a static site with Node.js and Express
