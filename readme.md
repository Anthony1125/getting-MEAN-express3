Getting MEAN application code
=============================

This is the code for the sample 'Loc8r' application that is built through the course of my book [Getting MEAN](http://www.manning.com/sholmes/).

This branch holds the code as it stands at the end of Chapter 3 *Creating and setting up a MEAN project*.

Clone this branch with the following commands (in a fresh folder)
```sh
$ git init
$ git clone -b chapter-03 https://github.com/simonholmes/getting-MEAN.git
```
Install the npm module dependencies:
```sh
$ cd getting-MEAN
$ npm install

Getting MEAN is published by Manning, and is currently available through their early access program: [www.manning.com/sholmes/](http://www.manning.com/sholmes/)
